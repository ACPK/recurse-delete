{"tagline":"Rails gem to recursively delete self and all dependent associations without an N+1","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"###Recurse Delete\r\nWhen you call *Record.destroy* in Rails, it instantiates all its associations (that are `:dependent => :destroy`) and calls destroy on each. This is an **N + 1**, you can delete all the associated records without the *N + 1* if you set the association as `:dependent => :delete_all`. However, this will not delete all the sub associations. This is the compromise recurse-delete solves. You can read more about it here: http://www.jisaacks.com/rails-dependent-destroy-n-1-s-got-you-down\r\n\r\nAdd to GemFile: `gem 'recurse-delete'`\r\n\r\nUsage: `Record.recurse_delete`","name":"Recurse-delete"}
