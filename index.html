        <h3>Recurse Delete</h3>

<p>When you call <em>Record.destroy</em> in Rails, it instantiates all its associations (that are <code>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</code>) and calls destroy on each. This is an <strong>N + 1</strong>, you can delete all the associated records without the <em>N + 1</em> if you set the association as <code>:dependent =&gt; :delete_all</code>. However, this will not delete all the sub associations. This is the compromise recurse-delete solves. You can read more about it here: <a href="http://www.jisaacks.com/rails-dependent-destroy-n-1-s-got-you-down">http://www.jisaacks.com/rails-dependent-destroy-n-1-s-got-you-down</a></p>

<p>Add to GemFile: <code>gem 'recurse-delete'</code></p>

<p>Usage: <code>Record.recurse_delete</code></p>
